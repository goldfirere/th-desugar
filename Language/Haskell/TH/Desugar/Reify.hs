--    @
--
-- 2. Check if @P@ is a record pattern synonym. If it isn't a record pattern
--    synonym, return 'Nothing'. If it is a record pattern synonym, it will
--    have @k@ record selectors @sel_1@, ..., @sel_k@.
--
-- 3. Check if @n@ is equal to some @sel_i@. If it isn't equal to any of them,
--    return @Nothing@. If it is equal to some @sel_i@, then return 'Just'

Note [Use unSigType in maybeReifyCon]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make sure to call unSigType on the type of a reified data constructor or
record selector. Otherwise, if you have this:

  data D (a :: k) = MkD { unD :: Proxy a }

Then the type of unD will be reified as:

  unD :: forall k (a :: k). D (a :: k) -> Proxy a

This is contrast to GHC's own reification, which will produce `D a`
(without the explicit kind signature) as the type of the first argument.

Note [Rejigging reified type family equations variable binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When reifying a type family instance (on GHC 8.8 or later), which quantified
type variables do you use? This might seem like a strange question to ask since
these instances already come equipped with a field of type `Maybe [TyVarBndr]`,
but it's not always the case that you want to use exactly that field. Here is
an example to better explain it:

  class C a where
    type T b a
  instance C (Maybe a) where
    type forall b. T b (Maybe a) = a

If the above instance were quoted, it would give you `Just [PlainTV b]`. But if
you were to reify ''T (and therefore retrieve the instance for T), you wouldn't
want to use that as your list of type variable binders! This is because
reifiying any type family always presents the information as though the type
family were top-level. Therefore, reifying T (in GHC, at least) would yield:

  type family T b a
  type instance forall b a. T b (Maybe a) = a

Note that we quantify over `b` *and* `a` here, not just `b`. To emulate this
GHC quirk, whenever we reify any type family instance, we just ignore the field
of type `Maybe [TyVarBndr]` and quantify over the instance afresh. It's a bit
tedious, but it gets the job done. (This is accomplished by the rejig_tvbs
function.)
-}

-- Consider the following class declaration:
--
--   [d| class C a where
--         method :: a -> b -> a |]
--
-- When reifying C locally, quantifyClassDecMethods serves two purposes:
--
-- 1. It quantifies the class method's local type variables. To illustrate this
--    point, this is how GHC would reify C:
--
--      class C a where
--        method :: forall b. a -> b -> a
--
--    Notice the presence of the explicit `forall b.`. quantifyClassDecMethods
--    performs this explicit quantification if necessary (as in the case in the
--    local C declaration, where `b` is implicitly quantified.)
-- 2. It emulates a quirk in the way old versions of GHC would reify class
--    declarations (Trac #15551). On versions of GHC older than 8.8, it would
--    reify C like so:
--
--      class C a where
--        method :: forall a. C a => forall b. a -> b -> a
--
--    Notice how GHC has added the (totally extraneous) `forall a. C a =>`
--    part! This is weird, but our primary goal in this module is to mimic
--    GHC's reification, so we play the part by adding the `forall`/class
--    context to each class method in quantifyClassDecMethods.
--
--    Since Trac #15551 was fixed in GHC 8.8, this function doesn't perform
--    this step on 8.7 or later.

-- 2.                  `forall b. a -> b -> a` (if `prepend` is False)
--
-- Whether you want `prepend` to be True or False depends on the situation.
-- When reifying an entire type class, like C, one does not need to prepend a

Note [The limitations of standalone kind signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A current limitation of StandaloneKindSignatures is that they cannot be applied
to associated type families. This can have some surprising consequences.
Consider the following code, taken from
https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/17072#note_221324:

  type C :: forall a -> a -> Constraint
  class C a b where
    type T a :: Type

The parent class C has a standalone kind signature, so GHC treats its
associated types as if they had CUSKs. Can th-desugar figure out the kind
that GHC gives to T?

Unfortunately, the answer is "not easily". This is because `type T a` says
nothing about the kind of `a`, so th-desugar's only other option is to inspect
the kind signature for C. Even this is for naught, as the `forall a -> ...`
part doesn't state the kind of `a` either! The only way to know that the kind
of `a` should be Type is to infer that from the rest of the kind
(`a -> Constraint`), but this gets perilously close to requiring full kind
inference, which is rather unwieldy in Template Haskell.

In cases like T, we simply give up and return Nothing when trying to reify
its kind. It's not ideal, but them's the breaks when you try to extract kinds
from syntax. There is a rather simple workaround available: just write
`type C :: forall (a :: Type) -> a -> Constraint` instead.
